<TAG_005>Dear Diary, I want
to be a teenager forever. I
don't want to grow up...
[ENDBLOCK]
<IGNORE>

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there a memory
within this lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this okay,
Mr. <Baruk>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is what okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
You lied to <Lion> about not
knowing the whereabouts of the
shipment from Darilsheid...
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't understand. Why?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's no concern of yours.
I suggest forgetting about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as we keep <Lion> here,
it won't be a problem..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's <Greybum> I'm worried about.
I hope the townspeople didn't notice...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, even if they did,
I doubt the townspeople
would tell them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk>, it seems <Lion> and his
group are headed for Calviola.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... Keep me informed
of all of their actions.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir... why are you keeping
an eye on Mr. <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that what adults are supposed
to do? Watch over the children?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So <Baruk> was in on
it from the beginning...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But why did he keep up
the good-guy act around
his employees?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe to avoid any risk
of being discovered?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He ended up being
pretty strong, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then... because
he was an adult.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? I don't
get it at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, excuse me.
Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm <Stahn>, and you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Please excuse me.
I work at this office.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm Nash. It's nice
to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash, huh...?
Nice to meet you too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Philia>. We've heard the
name Nash before, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have we? Actually,
yes, we have...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! It's Elena's father!
From Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
You know Elena?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We do. You see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah. So she wants to live with me,
not with her grandparents...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand.
I'll go meet Elena.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's great!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There's nothing inside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
A company shouldn't just
focus on profits, it should
help the people, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
My goal is to do just that
through the <Baruk> Foundation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I hear anything, I'll tell you.
Feel free to stay here in the
meantime.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish you hadn't been so reckless.
President <Hugo> could have gotten
angry with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk> truly wants
the best for Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk> was unusually
flustered when he found
out that you had left town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk>... Where
have you gone?
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a feeling that Mr. <Baruk>
won't be coming back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't wait to be transferred
to Seinegald's headquarters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! Uh... you didn't hear anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't wait to be transferred.
*mumble, mumble*
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk> is at Darilsheid's
headquarters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard Seinegald was attacked?
Is Oberon's headquarters okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if Mr. <Baruk> doesn't come
back, I will inherit his aspiration.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
