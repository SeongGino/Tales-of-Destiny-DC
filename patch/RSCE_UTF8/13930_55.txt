Mr. <Baruk>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, excuse me.
Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm <Stahn>, and you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Please excuse me.
I work at this office.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm Nash. It's nice
to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash, huh...?
Nice to meet you too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Philia>. We've heard the
name Nash before, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have we? Actually,
yes, we have...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! It's Elena's father!
From Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
You know Elena?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We do. You see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah. So she wants to live with me,
not with her grandparents...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand.
I'll go meet Elena.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's great!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There's nothing inside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
A company shouldn't just
focus on profits, it should
help the people, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
My goal is to do just that
through the <Baruk> Foundation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I hear anything, I'll tell you.
Feel free to stay here in the
meantime.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish you hadn't been so reckless.
President <Hugo> could have gotten
angry with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk> truly wants
the best for Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk> was unusually
flustered when he found
out that you had left town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Baruk>... Where
have you gone?
[ENDBLOCK]
Secretary
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a feeling that Mr. <Baruk>
won't be coming back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't wait to be transferred
to Seinegald's headquarters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! Uh... you didn't hear anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't wait to be transferred.
*mumble, mumble*
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk> is at Darilsheid's
headquarters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard Seinegald was attacked?
Is Oberon's headquarters okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Deputy
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if Mr. <Baruk> doesn't come
back, I will inherit his aspiration.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while, <Baruk>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, good to see you. Did
you get directions here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I found my way on my
own. No one in this town
has any manners.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you should
be saying that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, look! There's something
cute over there!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. The people of Calvalese
are somewhat wary of outsiders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
They developed that wariness
over a long history. Don't let
it bother you too much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What kind of history...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Calvalesians descend
from those defeated in an
ancient war.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was it... the Aeth'er War?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know how long ago this war
was, but they shouldn't be letting
it affect them for so long like this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is the logic of the
victor. Think about it 
from their perspective.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even now, the standard of
living in Calvalese is much
lower than in other lands.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
For many years, they were oppressed
by other countries. Leading to the
current tension.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
The reason we set up the
<Baruk> Foundation here is
so these people can enjoy
a higher standard of living.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, <Baruk>, that's incredible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never knew places
like this existed!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's easier said than done. I've
yet to achieve all of my goals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, we're getting off topic.
I received word from <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whatever this Eye of Atamoni is...
It seems important you find it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right! Do you know
anything about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've tried asking around, but I'm
afraid I've not heard anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, we will thoroughly investigate
every boat that comes to Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.
Until then, you're welcome to stay
in town.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Thank
you so much!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't mention it. You
know, I'm surprised.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
About what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's rare to see <Lion> get
along with people his age.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, we're buddies!
A friendship forged
in fire!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Right, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>, don't even joke
about that. These people
are no friends of mine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
C'mon, don't talk like that! We've
been through a lot together!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The only reason I've tolerated you
imbeciles is because I was ordered
to. I never needed your help!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm disgusted that you would think
we're friends, or even that we get
along. Got it? Don't say it again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't stand laid-back, careless,
overly-friendly people like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let the boy's words get to you.
He's always been somewhat abrasive.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fine. I know one day we'll
be the best of friends!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I like <Lion>. I'm sure he's
a good guy deep down.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
You may find him surprisingly
easy to understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
If his feelings ever do change,
you'll surely notice immediately.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
